# Example environment variables
# Copy this file to .env.development, .env.test, or .env.local and fill in the values

# Node environment
NODE_ENV=development

# Set to 'true' to enable MSW Mock Service Worker
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MSW_MOCK=false

# APP_ENV - Custom environment variable for runtime environment identification
#
# Why APP_ENV is necessary (not just NODE_ENV):
# Next.js automatically sets NODE_ENV to "production" after `next build`,
# regardless of the actual deployment target. This means NODE_ENV cannot
# distinguish between E2E testing, preview/staging, and real production.
#
# APP_ENV provides explicit control:
# - "development": Local development
# - "test": E2E testing, CI/CD pipelines, preview deployments with mocks
#
# To enable MSW in production builds for testing:
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MSW_MOCK=true APP_ENV=test pnpm build
APP_ENV=development
